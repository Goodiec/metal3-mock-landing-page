            <p>Metal³ (pronounced as Metal Kubed) is an open-source project and bare metal host provisioning tool that provides components that allow you to do bare metal host management for Kubernetes. It runs as a Kubernetes application and gives you a Kubernetes-native API for managing bare metal hosts. With Metal³, you can easily provision and manage bare metal hosts using Kubernetes APIs and tools. This makes it simpler to deploy and manage Kubernetes clusters on physical hardware, which is great for workloads that require low latency, high performance, or specialized hardware.</p>

                <h3>Mission</h3>
                <p>Metal³'s mission is to simplify the process of deploying and managing Kubernetes clusters on bare metal. They achieve this by providing a Kubernetes native API for managing bare metal hosts via a provisioning stack that runs on Kubernetes. Metal³ is designed to fit seamlessly into the Kubernetes ecosystem, leveraging existing tools to deliver a better bare metal experience.</p>

                <div class="col">
                <h3>Goals</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Integration with Kubernetes Ecosystem:</strong> Using the Kubernetes native API, Metal³ aims to make it easy for users to manage the underlying infrastructure using the same tools they use to manage applications running on the cluster.</li>
                    <li><strong>Self-Hosted:</strong> Metal³ is self-hosted, which means all the components run within the Kubernetes cluster. There's no need to deploy anything separately, making management hassle-free.</li>
                    <li><strong>Self-managing:</strong> Metal³ would manage the cluster itself so it has been tied with the machine API from the Sigma cluster lifecycle so that once you have the tool installed, everything works just the same way it would if you had a cloud-based cluster. So you're operating your bare metal cluster in the same way that you would on a cloud platform.</li>
                    <li><strong>Community-Driven:</strong> Metal³ is an open and collaborative project that encourages community-driven development, making it accessible for everyone to contribute to.</li>

                <h2>Data Intensive Workloads</h2>
                <p>Metal³ can be used to manage bare metal infrastructure for big data and machine learning workloads. By leveraging Metal³, organizations can more easily manage their bare metal infrastructure and run data-intensive workloads with greater efficiency.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="grid-item">
                <h2>Edge Computing</h2>
                <p>Metal³ is ideal for edge locations where low-latency and high-performance computing are required. It can provision and manage bare metal infrastructure in these locations, making it easier to run workloads that require quick response times.</p>

                <div class="grid-item">
                <h2>High-Performance Computing</h2>
                <p>Metal³ is great for high-performance computing (HPC) environments, where low-latency and high-performance computing are required for scientific simulations, data analysis, and machine learning workloads. It can help organizations manage their bare metal infrastructure and run these workloads more efficiently.</p>

                <h2>Telco and 5G</h2>
                <p>Metal³ is an excellent choice for Telco and 5G environments, where low latency, high-performance computing, and high availability are required for network function virtualization and other workloads.</p>

                <div class="grid-item">
                <h2>Bare Metal Actuator</h2>
                <p>This component is responsible for reacting to changes in Machine objects and acting as a BareMetalHost custom resource client, as defined by the cluster-API project.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="grid-item">
                <h2>Bare Metal Operator</h2>
                <p>This component manages bare metal hosts and exposes a new BareMetalHost custom resource in the Kubernetes API, enabling users to manage hosts in a declarative way. The operator automates host provisioning, introspection, and remediation using standard Kubernetes APIs, thus managing the lifecycle of bare metal hosts.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="grid-item">
                <h2>Bare Metal Management pods</h2>
                <p>The operator manages a set of tools that control the power on the host, monitor the host status, and provision images to the host. These tools run inside the pod with the operator and do not require any configuration by the user.</p>
